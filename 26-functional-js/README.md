#Functional JS

* Functions are **first class objects**
  * can be saved as variables and passed as arguments
  * - functions can return functions
  * - can save function to variable 
  * - can save a function inside an object
  * - take another function as argument (callbacks)
  * - IIFE
* **Declarative** versus **Imperative**
  * Imperative (procedural)
    * _How_ to do some operation
    * Based on statements such as `if`, `for`, and/or `switch`
  * Declarative
    * _What_ operations to do
    * Based on expressions which resolve to a value
* **Pure functions**
  * Given the same inputs, the function will always return the same output
  * Has no **side-effects**, meaning it doesn't change anything in the program
      * Modifying any external variable or object property
      * Logging to the console
      * Writing to the screen or a file
      * Triggering any external process
      * Calling any other functions with side-effects
  * Avoid **shared state**
      * Don't use variables/data from outside of the function
  * Avoid **mutating state**
      * Creating new objects: `Object.assign`

* **Higher-order functions** and reusability
  * HOF take a callback argument or return a function
  * Abstract or isolate actions, effects, or async flow control using callback functions, promises
  * Create utilities which can act on a wide variety of data types (think functional library)
  * **Partial application** of a function to its arguments or create a **curry**-able function for the purpose of reuse or function composition
  * Take a list of functions and return some composition of those input functions

* Function **composition**
  * Combine two or more functions to perform some computation
      * `f(g(x))`
  * Combine two or more functions to produce a new function
      * `f(g)(x) === f(g(x))`

* Function **closures**
  * A function can reference variables within its scope (when it was first declared)
  * Functions can access those captured variables even when the function is invoked outside their scope.
  * Like all functions can be assigned to a variable, be passed as an argument to a function, or be returned as a function result
