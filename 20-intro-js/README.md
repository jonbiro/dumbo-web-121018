* Callbacks
  * Function Composition
    * Using the return values of functions as arguments to other functions
      next(thank("u"))
    * Passing a function as a callback to another function
      thank("u", next)
  * Why
    * doing something more than once
    * using the return value of the callback
    * doing something later (setTimeout / interval)
    * doing something on the reg bay
