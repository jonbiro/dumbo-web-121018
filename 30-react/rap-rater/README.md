## React State && Events

- What are Props?
  - properties of a component that is immutable by that component but can be edited by the component's parent (if it has one)
- What is State?
  - is an object that holds information that falls into either or both of the following categories:
    1. the information comes from outside of our application, meaning we cannot pass it as a prop from a parent component.
    2. the information can be changed by the component.
- What are Events?
  - A way for HTML/DOM to trigger Js code
- What is a Callback Function?

  - A function that is passed to another function that that function can call at a later time

- How do we use these 4 things to allow our User to interact with our app?
